        '<p>In this experiment, you will have to remember some briefly presented textures that contain an orientation. You will need to do <strong>200</strong> trials (plus 8 practice trials), each of which takes about 3-5 seconds. It should take less than 50 minutes total. <strong>Please do not participate if you do not have normal or corrected-to-normal vision.</strong> </p><p>On each trial you will see two textures containing an orientation:</p><p align="center"><img src="instruction_screenshots/example_oris.png" width="400" border=0></p>	<p>When you click to start the trial, these stimuli will be presented only very briefly &mdash; shown for just 750 milliseconds (less than one second!) &mdash; so be sure not to click to start the trial until you are ready. <strong>Your job is to remember which exact orientation is in each location as best you can.</strong></p><p align="center"><img src="instruction_screenshots/example_ori.png" width="400" border=0></p><p>We are interested in your <b>VISUAL</b> memory. So it is important that you do not say the names of the angles to yourself or use words to perform the task. If you find yourself struggling not to do this, we suggest you repeat the word "the" over and over in your head when the items are presented. This will help you to remember not to use words to remember the orientations.</p> <p> After the orientation stimulus is presented, there will be a delay period during which either the screen will be blank or there will be a pure noise stimulus on the screen. <p align="center"><img src="instruction_screenshots/example_noise.png" width="400" border=0><img src="instruction_screenshots/example_blank.png" width="400" border=0> <p>After the delay with a blank or noise, you will be almost immediately tested on your memory on one of the two orientations picked at random. There will be a white line, which you can spin with the arrow keys to match the orientation that you remember:</p> <p align="center"><img src="instruction_screenshots/example_spinline.png" width="800" border=0>', 
            
        '<p>In sum, you will two textures with orientations. Then, after a brief delay with a blank or noise you will be asked to report the orientation of the item by spinning a line using the arrow keys.<p align="center"><img src="instruction_screenshots/trial_schema_ori_v2.png" width="800" border=0></p>',

Then you will need to do <strong>150</strong> trials of the main task.</p><p text-align="left">Before beginning, you must give informed consent. Please read the following and indicate your agreement by continuing to the next page to start the practice trials:</p> <div id="consentDiv"><p><u>Consent to Act as a Research Subject:</u></p><p style="text-align:left">Dr. John Serences is conducting a research study to learn more about how attention affects how you see things (perception) and how you make simple decisions. There will be approximately 5,000 participants in the study over the next 10 years.</p><p style="text-align:left">PROCEDURES. If you agree to be in this study by clicking NEXT and continuing to this task, the following will happen to you: You will be presented with stimuli that consist of simple shapes presented on a computer screen. You will respond with button presses and/or using your computer mouse.</p> <p style="text-align:left">RISKS. You will be required only to continue to interact with your web browser and make responses for a short duration. Thus, no potential risks or discomforts are anticipated except for the possibility that some tasks may be slightly boring. However, there may be risks that are currently unforeseeable.</p> <p style="text-align:left">REMUNERATION. In consideration of your time and effort you will receive SONA credit for your participation (0.5 credits for 30 minutes).</p><p style="text-align:left">RIGHTS.  If you are injured as a direct result of participation in this research, the University of California will provide any medical care you need to treat those injuries. The University will not provide any other form of compensation to you if you are injured. You may call the Human Research Protections Program at 858-246- 4777 for more information about this, to inquire about your rights as a research subject, or to report research- related problems.</p><p style="text-align:left">BENEFITS.  There will not be any direct benefit to you from these procedures. The investigator, however, may learn more about how human beings pay attention and how this ability affects perception and decision making. </p><p style="text-align:left">EXPLANATION.  Dr. John Serences or a member of his research team has explained this study to you and answered your questions. If you have other questions or research-related problems, you may reach him at 858- 534-3686.</p><p style="text-align:left">VOLUNTARY NATURE OF PARTICIPATION.  Participation in this research is entirely voluntary. There is no cost to you for participating. The alternative to participating is not participating.
